				<h2>To learn</h2>
				<p>Hackathons are a great way to give back to the community. Mentoring beginners is always helpful for them and rewarding for us.
				 We’re going to have mentors from a number of different organizations present at the venue. 
				 Whenever you’re stuck on a problem or need suggestions they'll always be within a hand’s reach.</p>

				<h2>To build</h2>
				<p>This year we are inviting not just students but everyone to build on ideas of their choice. 
				Watching software materialize from pure thought, part by part is the closest to experiencing magic we have ever got to.
				And we’re excited to see that magic happen all over again!</p>
